## Project Demo
https://teppy90.github.io/<br />

## Project Scope and Approach
The scope of the project is being able to fetch data dynamically from open source APIs, to present the important data in the most user friendly way.
The APIs that are utilized are
- https://openweathermap.org/api

The website will comprise of 4 components. 
1. The first component consists of a modal, giving information about the game.
2. The second component consists of a mini weather app that returns weather from a country (based on user input). The information is drawn from the API. 
3. The third component is a simple function that calculates several variables to generate a result that is used in the fourth component.
4. The fourth component consists of a function that calculates several variables (probabilities) to return a result.

## Technology utilized 
1. Jquery to manipulate DOM element and append the information retrieved from APIs
2. HTML and CSS 
3. Ajax call to fetch data from open source APIs
4. Javascript for the logic of adjusting variables.
5. Bootstrap to make the website responsive

## Difficulties / Limitation
As I researched how to do my project, there were many features I thought were suitable. For example, using local storage to return scores after the whole process so that users could adjust inputs to optimization. Code would break so for the sake of the deadline, I will be content with the base game. I will continue to do research into features to implement properly into the app.
